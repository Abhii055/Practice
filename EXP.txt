USER STORY
A user story is the smallest unit of work. Instead of focusing on what the system should do, the user story describes the benefit to the end user and what they want from your product. It does not describe a product feature but defines an end goal that the user wants to achieve when using the software. User stories are written in plain language thatâ€™s easy for everyone to understand.

A good user story should be easy to understand, independent, negotiable, estimable, and testable.

As a [type of user or role], I want to [end goal] so that I [do this].

My understanding of a Customer Success intern's main responsibilities includes working closely with client to understand their processes and business challenges in order to create business requirements and project plans. i know there are number of accounts handled by a CSM so handling key accounts and issues based on their severity level within a specific time frame is necessary. A CSM also collaborates with various internal teams to gain a brief understanding of the client and project, ensuring a holistic view of all aspects. Furthermore, CSM help clients by giving training on new features and functionalities to maximize their use of the product or service and it is very essential to maintaining a healthy relationship and ensuring client satisfaction.

and one more responsibility is to prevent the accounts from churning 

When a client is not satisfied, the chances of the account being put in a frozen stage or even churning  means that the client no longer wants to continue with LeadSquared. This situation arises when a client feels helpless and thinks that after go-live there will be no one to help and train them. Therefore, the CSM is responsible for preventing accounts from churning, and ensure they are fully supported throughout their journey.

To keep an account in a running state and to keep the client happy, we need to maintain a healthy relationship with the client. This includes taking regular follow-ups to address any issues or problems they may face of if they want help in some particular and want to know more about our new connectors, and we can  suggest  them as per there business cases with new connectors to grow their business and LSQ business as well. and providing training on new features and functionalities of the product so that the client and their team can utilize it to the fullest extent. 

SO i think these are some main pointers which makes business healthy and creates a good culture.

Why  i wanted to join US shift?

when we learn something we use to create a  circle around us that i can not change my path from now

	Working in a US shift - offers a unique opportunity to gain experience and develop skills in a global context,  so what i meant by  this is i worked with a client who's vendor is from Europe (FIVE9 its a telephony vendor) I worked with them and i really got impressed that how they good in entrepreneurship rather than a technical person and i think  which is crucial for my career growth.

I believe working with US clients and colleagues will significantly grow my understanding of international business practices i think which again very necessary for someone's growth.
